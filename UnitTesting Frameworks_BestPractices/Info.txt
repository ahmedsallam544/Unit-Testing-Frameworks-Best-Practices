Primarily job for Unit Testing is completely for Developers.

 But, when we talk about Quality ortesting 
 then it would be a different answer.
 -Each test should be Readable, Independent, Repeatable, and Reliable.
 • One function may have multiple unit tests according to the
 usage and outputs of the function.

 Tests ensure
 - The code meets expectations and specifications
 • i.e. it does what it says it should do.
 - The code continues to meet expectations over time
 • i.e. avoiding regression.
 --------------------------------------------------------
Why Unit Test
• Better designs
Helps to produce better code
- Readable
- Maintainable
Testing makes developer slow down andthink before writing a code
Reduce bugs in existing and new features
Testing makes development faster
-------------------------------------------------------
Triple-A Structure is the Conceptual Test
• Arrange
• Act
• Assert
------------------------------------------
Unit Test Best Practices
• Single Responsibility
- One test should be responsible for onescenario only.

Self Descriptive
Unit test must be easy to read and understand
Variable Names - Method Names - Class Names - Self descriptive

Test should have no uncertainty:
• All inputs should be known
• Method behavior should be predictable
• Split in to two tests rather than using “If” or “Case”
• No test logic in Production Code
• No Exception Handling - Let other exceptions go uncaught.
• Informative Assertion Messages (By reading the assertion message, we shouldknow why the test failed and what to do.
)

## Testing Frameworks
Using Testing Frameworks gives

- a way to designate things as being testesthat need to be run using “Attributes”
- a way to compare the expected state againstthe actual one through using of “Assertions”
-Test Runner It is a tool that executes the tests.
--------------------------------------------------------
ExpectedException Attribute
 -- behaves correctly by throwing an exception we used 
    ExpectedExceptionattribute .
	 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Naming Convention

Class preforming tests : classNameTest
Testing Function (individual task)
- ShouldBehaviorBeenTested
- MethodName_StateBeforeAct_ExpectedResult
Instance of class being tested
sut : System Under Test
cut : Code/Class Under Test

------------------------------------------------------------
DATA DRIVEN TEST
An excellent way to verify the correct behavior of code is to execute 
it usingrealistic data.

A unit test is made data-driven by assigning attributes for connecting to and
reading from a data source.
• unit test will be called once per row in the data source.

##Data Driven Test Steps
 1. data source 
 2. TestContext field
 3. Use the DataRow indexer property to retrieve the values  you use in a test.

 ##Data Source Types  
 1. XML
 2. EXCL
 3. SQL Express
